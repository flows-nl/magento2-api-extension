# Flows Magento 2 API Extensions

This module extends the Magento 2 API with functionality that is already available in Magento 2, but not exposed in the API.

* Catalog rules through `/V1/flows/catalogRules`, similar to how shopping cart rules are already implemented in the API

You can always check the version number of the installed extension using `/V1/flows/version`.
